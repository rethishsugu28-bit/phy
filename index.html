            <p class="abstract cinematic-element">This report details the design, construction, and rigorous testing of a low-power Wire-less Power Transfer (WPT) system centered on the principle of **Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)**. The system successfully demonstrated contactless energy transmission between a primary (transmitter) resonant coil and a secondary (receiver) coil.</p>

            <h2 class="cinematic-element">The Objective: Near-Field Inductive Coupling</h2>
            <p class="large-text cinematic-element">The primary objective was to design and build a functional, small-scale prototype for wireless power transfer (WPT) using near-field inductive coupling. The system was designed to reliably illuminate an LED or charge a small electronic load over a short distance (~5-10 mm) while providing empirical validation of the underlying physics.</p>

                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h3>Fundamental Principle</h3>
                    <p>The system relies on **Faraday's Law of Induction**. A higher rate of change of magnetic flux (i.e., higher operating frequency) results in a greater induced voltage.</p>

                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h3>Transmitter Circuit</h3>
                    <p>A **555 Timer IC** was configured in astable mode to generate a precise square wave oscillation in the range of **100 kHz to 200 kHz**. This high frequency minimizes the required inductance value.</p>

                    <p>A **Full-Wave Bridge Rectifier** utilizing high-speed **Schottky Diodes** was implemented. Schottky diodes were chosen for their lower forward voltage drop (~0.3 V), minimizing power loss.</p>

                    <h3>1. Resonant Matching Optimization</h3>
                    <p>Implementation of a precise, coupled **LC-Tank Resonant Circuit** on both sides. This would significantly increase the Quality factor ($Q$) of the coils and extend the functional charging range up to **50-100 percent**.</p>

                    <p>Integrating a mechanism to detect metallic objects between the coils is crucial for safety. This prevents power loss due to eddy currents and localized heating.</p>

                    <h3>3. Feedback and Power Control</h3>
                    <p>Developing a simple communication channel would allow the receiver to request variable power levels. This approach will maximize efficiency and reduce standby power consumption.</p>
